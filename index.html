          </h3>
          <p>3D Shogi is a new take on Shogi, a Japanese chess-like game, that pits two players against each other in a strategic battle. Players will capture pieces from each other in a 3D board rather than a 2D board for added layers of strategy. Pieces will be able to move from layer to layer and capture pieces in a new fashion that will expand the world of Shogi as we know it.</p>

          <p>A project for CS 175 Project in AI class. We trained an AI based in Microsoft's Malmo and Minecraft using a neural network we developed using the Tensorflow API and Reinforced Deep Q-Learning. We passed in data such as position of enemies relative to the AI, its line of sight, and also images for it recognize when an enemy was in front of it. We rewarded the AI for landing attacks or killing a target while taking away reward points for taking damage and ultimately dying. The project was successful in teaching the AI to fight against a range of 1-3 Zombies with average win-rates of above 66.5% when using the strongest weapon while having a 40% win-rate when facing 1v1 with the weakest weapon.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>In this project, we aimed to apply Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) on various corpuses of Yu-Gi-Oh trading card text, as well as create a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Model to categorize the cards into different groups.Yu-Gi-Oh is a collectible card game made and developed in Japan. The game has over 10,000 cards in its database and includes many different mechanics and card types. The cards are mainly split into 3 categories: monsters, spells, and trap cards. However, each topic has their own specific sub-group and effects. With the amount of cards and effects within the game, interaction in the game requires players to know a vast amount of information about certain cards and their effects.For this project, we wanted to test how effectively we could search for cards based on certain keywords using TF-IDF and if we could find any meaningful relationships between cards using LDA.</p>

          <p>A project for CS 113 Project in Game Development. BCU is a series of mini-games that simulate what a student expect to learn in college. From building robots for defense in Engineer, creating viruses in Biology, and creating drugs in that send people into crazy hallucinations, BCU allow students to live their fantasy. They will play through minigames and obtain degrees for their respective majors and can return to obtain another. The school is open for any of those who want to learn what students really learn at school. Assets were obtained from different means such as the Unity Assets store and other online providers.</p>

          <p>An Orchestra Simulator based with the player as a manager of an Orchestra. As the manager, the player will schedule auditions, plan recitals and rehearsals, and schedule other events. The player will work from their apartment, schedule auditions and practices at the practice hall, and play at large venues within our city. The player's performance will then be measured by critics who will assign them a score based on how well their orchestra performed. With little practice, the orchestra will fail to perform their piece well and result in off-beat tempos and unsynchronized performers. Listen to how your orchestra will perform.</p>

          <p>Ninja Story is a 2D platformer action RPG that I made for ICS 161 as my second project. This game focuses heavily on 2D colliders with damage detection and precise timing of actions. Our hero finds themselves awake one day in a world filled with magic and must defeat his enemies to return home. The world is filled with knights and dragons that will do whatever they can to defeat the ninja for trespassing onto their land. With each passing portal, enemies become stronger and the ninja must quickly dodge his enemy's attacks and avoid losing life as there will be no restoration potions in this world. Assets were obtained from the Assets store.</p>
